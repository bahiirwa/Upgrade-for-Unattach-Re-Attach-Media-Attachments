Allows to unattach and reattach images and other attachments from within the media library page.

== Description ==

WordPress allows to attach (or assign) images and other media attachments organized within the Media Library to posts and pages. A file will automatically be attached when uploading it in the post creation form. There are also "Attach" links in the Media Library to manually attach files to posts. Once attached there is no way to unattach or re-attach images, pdfs or any attachment in WordPress core.

This plugin fills this gap by providing two additional links next to "Attach" in the **Media Library**:

*   **Re-Attach**: Allows to choose a new post to attach the file to
*   **Unattach**: Totally removes an existing relation between an attachment and a post
*   Shows date the media attachment was uploaded.

== Bulk Actions ==
The plugin also provides bulk actions for unattaching and re-attaching multiple files at once! *Select the files* you want to change, select your desired action from the *Bulk Actions* dropdown and hit *Apply*.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin to your blog
1. Activate it as any other plugin. *It will work out of the box*.
1. Go to your media library and view as list
1. You can now unattach and re-attach attachments to various posts and pages in your blog/website.


== Note ==
[Building this plugin came from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45690582/image-post-attachments-not-specific-to-post/45705413#45705413). Thanks to [Unattach and Re-attach Media Attachments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unattach-and-re-attach-attachments/) which inspired this plugin. His plugin has not been maintained for years yet it is simple, powerful, with lean code. So I have just added upgrades of the code as illustrated in Changelog.
